My name is Michael Broschinsky and I am an adjunct instructor in the [political science program](https://www.slcc.edu/pols/) at [Salt Lake Community College](https://www.slcc.edu/).

I have taught at the college since [2004](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004). My academic training was at the [University of Utah](https://www.utah.edu/) where I received a bachelor of arts in political science, and a master of public administration. In addition to my academic background, I also bring 25 years of government experience at the [Office of Administrative Rules](https://rules.utah.gov/).
